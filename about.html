    <h1>About Us</h1>

    <p><strong>World News Navigator</strong> is a free, independent web directory that helps users explore newspapers and news portals from around the world, organized by continent and country.</p>

    <p>Our goal is to simplify access to international journalism, connect people with trusted sources, and promote media diversity without language or geographic barriers.</p>

    <p>We do not create or host news content. Instead, we provide direct access to the official websites of major newspapers globally.</p>

    <h2>Project Ownership</h2>
    <p>This project is developed and maintained by <strong>Tin@Ko</strong>, a digital initiative focused on accessibility, neutrality, and freedom of information.</p>
